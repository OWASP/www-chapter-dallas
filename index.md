- Bio:  Derek Orgeron is an Enterprise Account Executive for Secure Code Warrior, a global security company that makes software development better and more secure. After spending his entire career in the technology and SAAS space, Derek is passionate about educating organizations on better security coding practices and building lasting partnerships.

- Description:  Are. You. Ready? Head to the AppSec battlefield and prove that you are the ultimate secure coding champion. Go head-to-head with your peers as you test your web application security knowledge of the OWASP Top 10. Strut your skills. Crush the competition. Score excellent prizes and take home the title of Secure Code Warrior! The same application security vulnerabilities that plagued developers 10 years ago still exist asa problems today. Coders know how to code, but can they code securely? True security champions are hard to find, but they can be hiding in your midst. Maybe it's you?? Time to prove your skills. Players will be presented with a series of vulnerable code challenges that will ask them to identify the problem, locate the insecure code, and fix the vulnerability. It's gamified, it's relevant, but most of all - it's fun. Watch as you earn points and climb to the top of the real-time leaderboard during the event. Prizes will be awarded to the top 3 point scorers, with one security superhero being crowned the ultimate Secure Code Warrior. Will it be you?
