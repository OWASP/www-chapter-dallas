AWS offers an IoT stack that has the goal of simplifying gaining value from smart device - edge device - cloud orchestration. The stack is deceptively simple to use, but, as always, the devil is in the detail when it comes to security.<br>
This talk will:<br> 
  - Introduce the AWS IoT stack<br> 
  - Provide a quick overview of the ETSI EN[masked] security guidelines<br> 
  - Show how AWS security features can help support the recommendations in the ETSI standard by working through a practical use case: EZTEA<br> <br>
