## OWASP Dallas February Meeting
- When:  Tuesday, February 18, 2020 - 6:00 PM

- Bio:  Tim Witos, is an information security and information technology professional. In the field since 2006, he has worked as a product security leader at Experian as well as developed a technology consulting practice at RSM US LLP (formerly McGladrey). He has led global service capabilities at numerous companies -- including a global security testing program across 37 countries. Tim enjoys t-shirts, scotch and air travel.
- Description:  A multinational application penetration testing program involves more than just great penetration testers. Scheduling, scoring, and cultural understanding can mean the difference between a successful model and a catastrophic failure.
