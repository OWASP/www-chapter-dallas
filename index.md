## OWASP Dallas April Meeting
<b>When:</b><br> Tuesday, April 27, 2021 - 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM CT<br><br>
<b>Title:</b><br> OWASP API Security Top 10 - New List, New Threats<br><br>
<b>Bio:</b><br> Ran Barth is a Principal Security Engineer at Salt Security. He has a passion for web application security, and he has spent his career deploying enterprise security solutions. Ran currently resides in Plano, TX and is originally from Israel.<br><br>
<b>Info:</b><br> 
APIs are constantly changing and have access to an organization’s most sensitive data, and APIs now represent >80% of web traffic. This reality is attracting attackers that are finding new ways of getting what they’re looking for in custom-made APIs. As a response, OWASP has created a new Top 10 specific to API risks and this presentation will explain and discuss each item.
